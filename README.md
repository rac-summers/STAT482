The 'KLdivergence.R' file contains the code for calculating and displaying KL divergence between the states. The 'catboost and MLR model.R' file contains the code for building and running the CatBoost model and multiple linear regression model. It also contains code for visualizing the predictions of both models. That data that we used to build our models, calculate KL divergence, and create visualizations are also included.
